    description: "SAES started its journey in 1940 from a small laboratory, and during its 80 years of innovation, always put Research at the center. At that time the filament in the thermionic valves of amplifiers had a short life because it burned out quickly. SAES found a solution to prevent it from burning: getter, which absorbed the oxygen molecules extending the filament life. This has always been the Company’s approach: solving problems with highly innovative solutions, with the aim of improving the quality of life, adapting and modifying the getter for different applications.
We are glad to be part of the most important innovations of our daily lives, from fusion energy, to 5G, from mobiles image stabilizers to medical pods, from compostable packaging to domotics and actuators.
SAES is always looking for new solutions to today's and tomorrow's problems and to develop new materials and applications. 
Young talented physicists can get involved in big international projects and give their contribution in many fields of physics applications. Want to take part to innovation? <br>
