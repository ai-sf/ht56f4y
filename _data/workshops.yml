    description: "SAES started its journey in 1940 from a small laboratory, and during its 80 years of innovation, always put Research at the center. At that time the filament in the thermionic valves of amplifiers had a short life because it burned out quickly. SAES found a solution to prevent it from burning: getter, which absorbed the oxygen molecules extending the filament life. This has always been the Company’s approach: solving problems with highly innovative solutions, with the aim of improving the quality of life, adapting and modifying the getter for different applications.
We are glad to be part of the most important innovations of our daily lives, from fusion energy, to 5G, from mobiles image stabilizers to medical pods, from compostable packaging to domotics and actuators.
SAES is always looking for new solutions to today's and tomorrow's problems and to develop new materials and applications. 
Young talented physicists can get involved in big international projects and give their contribution in many fields of physics applications. Want to take part to innovation? <br>

    description: "Andrea is a quantum computing researcher and the co-founder of a quantum computing company (which is still in stealth mode). From 2019 to 2021 he was an It from Qubit Simons Collaboration Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin hosted by Scott Aaronson.
Prior to that he was a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford and a Graduate Fellow at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics."

    description: "The National Institute of Metrological Research (INRiM) is a national public body established by Legislative Decree of 21 January 2004 n. 38.
INRiM carries out and promotes research in the field of metrology, develops the most advanced standards and measurement methods and related technologies, through which it fulfills the functions of primary metrological institute pursuant to the law of 11 August 1991, n. 273. To this end, as a signatory of international agreements on metrology, also upon delegation from the competent institutions, and similarly to the metrological institutes of other countries, INRiM creates and maintains the national standards for the units of measurement necessary for traceability and the legal value of measurements in the sectors of industry, commerce, scientific research, health and environmental protection, as well as for measurement needs in the judicial field and for any other sector in which the high scientific-technological contents typical of metrological research find relevant application effects.
INRiM also enhances, disseminates and transfers knowledge and results in the science of measurements and research on materials in order to promote national technological development and improve the quality of life and services for citizens."
