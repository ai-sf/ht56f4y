    - name: Matteo Vismara
      president: y
      bio: "
    After having chaired the local committee of Milan (AISFUnimi) in the last two years, since May 2022 he has held the position of President of the Italian Association of Physics Students (AISF). Student in the last year of a master's degree at the 'Aldo Pontremoli’ Physics Department of the University of Milan, he wishes to specialize in the field of matter physics. In particular, interested in the applications that Physics has in multidisciplinary fields, he is looking for transversal projects that can allow him to combine the fun of the experimental with the rigor of the theoretical. Characterized by great enthusiasm, he throws himself headlong into many projects, punctually forgetting that his days have only 24 hours. Passionate about philosophy, he loves to spend time reading the great classics of thought. In his spare time, in addition to dedicating himself to relationships with friends, he seeks contact with nature by taking long walks in the woods, sailing on the lake or climbing.

      bio: "
    He is a curious child always fascinated by how beauty and complexity can emerge from simplicity: he loves music, mountains and the contact with nature. He spends hours in the night letting his eyes wander around the sky.
    As you may guess, he is now specializing in theoretical Physics of Complex Systems and (less trivially) in the Physics of Proteins.
    When organizing PLANKCS gets hard, he thinks about all the people he is going to meet and the friendships he’s going to build and that is what gives him strength to carry on and raise the bar!

      bio: "
    I'm Elisa Stabilini, a master's degree student of Physics of Data here in Milan. The choice of this degree program is tightly related to my interests beyond physics: I'm super fascinated by the possibility to describe and analyze social, economical, and environmental problems through data. Indeed the decision to pick up a major in Physics came from the idea that the study of physics can provide me with a toolbox that helps me understand the complex phenomena we are living in.

    I joined AISF a few years ago, during the COVID pandemic, in order to keep in touch with other students like me. I soon got involved in the organization of activities and meetings for other students. Within the PLANCKS2023 organization, I helped in contacting and working with the sponsor, I also helped a little bit with the creation of content for the site.

    I genuinely hope, together with the other team members, to have been able to organize a nice experience and stay in Milan. See you soon!

    Luca Radavelli is a strange kind of animal. His natural habitat is the couch where he spends most of his time watching Movies and TV Series. He can also be found studying Physics, but this behavior has been rarely obserbed. Another sighting area is the University of Milan where he is a master's student specializing in Theoretical Physics. Surprisingly he is the Vice President of the Local Committee of AISF (Italian Association of Physics Students) even though such a position should have gone to a more responsible person. In the organization of PLANCKS 2023, he is the head of the Scientific Program, which has the goal to ensure a high level of scientific divulgation during this ambitious event. For this reason, all the other organizers are keeping a close eye on him to make sure that he doesn’t do something really stupid which would ruin PLANCKS for everyone.

    Hi everyone! My name is Gloria. I am an Italian Physics student at Università degli Studi di Milano. I love Particle Physics, both the theoretical and the experimental aspects of this fascinating subject.
    In my spare time, I like traveling, listening to music and spending time with my family and friends. I am trying to learn how to play the piano and sing at the same time… it’s quite difficult! I need a lot more practice.
    When PLANCKS OC Presidents proposed PLANCKS project to my attention, I thought we would never be able to overcome all the difficulties. However, to my great surprise, we made it! Our success was possible only with the help of everyone. Through this experience, I have learned the importance of working together for a common purpose and communicating with each other, besides having great fun!

    I've always loved meeting new people, communicating and exchanging ideas, especially with people coming from different cultures and realities. So, two years ago I decided to join AISF and I soon became involved in various activities of the association.
    In the organization of Plancks, I'm part of the Social Team, helping to manage the Instagram account and create infographics.
    In addition to my passion for science, I've always felt a strong interest in art in all its forms. I'm part of a dance company, I play the clarinet in the city band, and I recently started learning the ukulele. I also enjoy drawing, as it's a great way to express my thoughts on social issues.

    His heart is divided between arts and track & field: you may see him taking pictures in the surroundings, or finishing some last minute design. If not, he's definitely training."

    Member of the local committee of AISF Milano Statale (Italian Association of Physics Students) from the first year of university, she has always been a strong supporter of all the projects carried out and a promoter among the youngest. Being always curious about every aspect of the world around her, she could choose the only degree program that would allow her to answer all the questions that came to her mind (or almost all of them!). She's passionate about astrophysics and deeply torn between her love for the stars and all the computational aspects of a subject. Determined to achieve her goals, stubborn, she throws headlong until a problem is solved, at the cost of losing hours of sleep and becoming mad. When she's not programming something super intricate, you can find her reading a book curled up in an armchair, endlessly chatting about some TV series and anime with friends, or at the gym, lifting objects of various kinds to ease her tension.
