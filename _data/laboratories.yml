The multimedia pills, usable through the MARSS app, starting from the ancient astronomical instruments, allow to weave a bridge between the history of science and the avant-garde of astronomical research. Thanks to the app, it will also be possible to visit four places in Milan of particular interest for astronomy: the Brera palace, the Brera botanical garden, the Indro Montanelli gardens and the sundial of the Milan cathedral. With the new digital technologies, the MusAB tools will take you on a journey to discover their link with history, the city and the frontiers of astronomy, making the Brera Astronomical Museum unique on the national scene: an extraordinary place of intersection between science and history."

    description: "If you choose this option you will have the opportunity to visit two laboratories. The first one, the Photonics Laboratory (POPLAB) focusses on organic semiconductors, which are made with materials based on carbon rather than silicon as in conventional electronics. The themes of the visit will be: design of organic semiconductors, structure-property relationships in organic semiconductors, large-area processing for thin-film electronics and organic devices. The second one, the SmartMatLab Center (SML) is an interdisciplinary advanced facility which includes in turn two laboratories, one equipped with a series of spectroscopic equipments to perform a complete photophysical characterization of molecular organic materials and inorganic ones in the form of solution or solid state; and the second one which allows for the fabrication of devices by means of different thin film deposition techniques."

    description: "SAES started its journey in 1940 from a small laboratory, and during its 80 years of innovation, always put Research at the center. At that time the filament in the thermionic valves of amplifiers had a short life because it burned out quickly. SAES found a solution to prevent it from burning: getter, which absorbed the oxygen molecules extending the filament life. This has always been the Company’s approach: solving problems with highly innovative solutions, with the aim of improving the quality of life, adapting and modifying the getter for different applications.
We are glad to be part of the most important innovations of our daily lives, from fusion energy, to 5G, from mobiles image stabilizers to medical pods, from compostable packaging to domotics and actuators.
SAES is always looking for new solutions to today's and tomorrow's problems and to develop new materials and applications. 
Young talented physicists can get involved in big international projects and give their contribution in many fields of physics applications. Want to take part to innovation? <br>

    description: "For more than 40 years, quantum computing has intrigued and amazed scientists and non-scientists in its future possibility for solving problems that are intractable using classical computing.
Since 2016, IBM has made real quantum computers available on the cloud so that clients, students, and researchers can begin to learn and experiment with this new way of computing. IBM is advancing the quantum field across hardware, software and the growth of the global quantum ecosystem: during this workshop,
we will see what potentials exist in various industries, the state of quantum computing today, and how you can get on the right path to make the earliest use of this rapidly evolving technology, with a series of hands-on sessions to start interacting with a real physical device in the cloud."

    description: "The INFN Laboratory of Accelerators and Applied Superconductivity (LASA) is an international center of excellence in the field of cutting-edge technologies for particle accelerators based in Segrate, near Milan.
LASA develops advanced technologies for superconductivity, cryogenics and the production of high-intensity static and radiofrequency electromagnetic fields. Here the first European superconducting cyclotron was built, and third in the world, in operation since 1994 at the INFN Southern National Laboratories.
The primary mission of LASA today consists in the development of superconducting systems for particle acceleration, with radiofrequency (RF) cavities, and for beam guidance, with magnets.
Alongside this, LASA perpetuates its tradition in the experimental field by participating in the study and development of experiments in the field of innovative acceleration schemes."
