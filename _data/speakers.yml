   biography: "Claudia Pasquero is an Associate Professor in Oceanography and Atmospheric Physics at the University of Milano – Bicocca, research associate at the Institute of Science of the Atmosphere and Climate of the National Research Council, vice-president of the Committee on Mathematical Geophysics of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics. Pasquero studies the interactions between oceans and climate and works on the interactions between ocean dynamics and marine ecosystems. Recently, her research has led to significant improvements in the understanding of the dynamics of typhoons and hurricanes.
In 2020 Pasquero won a grant from the European Space Energy for the project GLAUCO to study the study of Global and Local Atmospheric response to the Underlying Coupled Ocean and since 2021 is working on the  project EUREC4A-OA - Improving the representation of small-scale nonlinear ocean-atmosphere interactions in Climate models by innovative joint observing and modeling approaches, founded by the European Union.

 - name: Didier Queloz
   #date: Friday, 12<span class="super">th</span>
   #topic: Is quantum mechanics correct?
   biography: "Didier Queloz is a professor of physics at the University of Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory and professor of astronomy at ETH Zurich and director of the ETH Centre for Origin and  Prevalence of Life. He is one of the originators of the “exoplanet revolution” in astrophysics. In 1995, as part of his PhD, his team announced the first discovery of a giant planet orbiting another star, outside the solar system, a discovery which led him and his colleague Micheal Mayor to obtain the Nobel Prize in Physics. This seminal discovery spawned a revolution in astronomy and kickstarted the research field of exoplanet systems. Over the next 25 years, Didier Queloz’s main scientific contributions have essentially focused on expanding the detection and measurement capabilities of these systems to retrieve information on their physical structure."

#   topic: "Newton's Principia Mathematica: an introduction."
   biography: "Paolo Milani is Full Professor at the Department of Physics of the University of Milano.
He graduated in Physics from the University of Pavia (Italy) and he received his Docteur es
Sciences (PhD) in 1991 from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (CH). He is the
founder of the Molecular Beams and Nanocrystalline Materials Laboratory at the University of
Milano.
His research focuses on cluster-assembled nanostructured materials for neuromorphic
systems, stretchable electronics, biomedicine, soft robotics. He has published more than 300
papers on refereed journals, several review papers and a monograph on supersonic cluster beam
deposition for the synthesis of nanostructured thin films.
Milani is the recipient of the U. Campisano Award from the Italian Institute for the
Physics of Matter in 2000 for his contributions to the field of the synthesis and characterization of
nanostructured materials. In 2006 he received the L. Tartufari Prize awarded by the Lincei
National Academy.
Currently, Milani serves as Director of the Interdisciplinary Center for Nanostructured
Materials and Interfaces of the University of Milano.
He holds more than thirty patents in the field of nanotechnology and he is co-founder of four
companies: TETHIS active in the field of nanostructured devices for early cancer diagnostics, WISE
producing implantable electrodes for neuromodulation, EOS producing optical diagnostic systems for
nanoparticles in complex biological fluids, HUVANT active in the field of 3D printing of haptic
phantoms for surgical training."
