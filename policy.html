We ask conference participants to read and adhere to the PLANCKS Events code of conduct policy that outlines behaviour that will not be tolerated at this conference.

<h3>
Non-Discrimination & Anti-Harassment Policy 
</h3>

<p>
We are committed to providing a conference experience where everyone is treated with respect, free from discrimination or harassment based on race, colour, gender, ethnicity, ancestry, national or cultural origin, religion, creed, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, pregnancy, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, genetic information, veteran or military status, marital status, citizenship status or socio-economic status, or on any other legally prohibited basis.
Discrimination or harassment of conference participants will not be tolerated in any form. Conference participants violating this rule may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the conference staff immediately.
The organising committee will name an advisor who will consult with those who have suffered from harassment and who will suggest ways of redressing their problems, and an advisor who will counsel those accused of harassment.
Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
Participants are expected to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.
The organising committee of PLANCKS conference endorses and adopts the following policies of the IUPAP (International Union of Pure and Applied Physics):

<h3>
International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) Policy Statements
</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Free Circulation of Scientists:</b> The principle of the Universality of Science is fundamental to scientific progress. This principle embodies freedom of movement, association, expression and communication for scientists, as well as equitable access to data, information and research materials. In pursuing its objectives with respect to the rights and responsibilities of scientists, the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) actively upholds this principle, and, in so doing, opposes any discrimination on the basis of such factors as ethnic origin, religion, citizenship, language, political stance, gender, or age. IUPAP should only sponsor conferences and events at institutions and in countries that uphold this principle. If scientists are excluded from attending IUPAP-sponsored international conferences by a host institution or country on the basis of any of these factors, IUPAP should register its concern at the highest level of that institution or country, and should not sponsor any future events in that country until such exclusions have been eliminated.

</li>
<li>
<b>Harassment at Conferences:</b> It is the policy of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) that all participants at an IUPAP-supported Conference will enjoy a comfortable experience, and that they will treat each other with respect at all times. The conference organisers will appoint two advisors at the conference who will consult with those who have suffered from harassment and who will suggest ways of redressing their problems, and an advisor who will counsel those accused of harassment.
